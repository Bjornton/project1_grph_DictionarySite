## Description
A wonderful project brought to you by Meghana Vasireddy, Seeha Sangwang, Carlos Smith, and Robert Severson!

Welcome to Ordbok!

Ordbok is a web application that utilizes APIs to generate a certain word, find the definition of said word, and also display a relevant GIF (if applicable). Ordbok utilizes 3 APIs in total - the Random Word API by Herokuapp (http://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home), the Merriam Webster Dictionary API (https://dictionaryapi.com), and the Giphy API (https://developers.giphy.com). After opening the application, the user will have 2 options - the first allows the user to click the "Random Word" button located in the header and be presented with any random word. If the generated word does not have a definition, a message is displayed, prompting the user to try again. If the generated word does have a definition, it is presented in the "Defintion" box. Some words will also display a relevant gif in the adjacent "Image" box. For words that do not have an associated gif, a default gif will be presented along with default text, informing the user that there is no image. The second option to use Ordbok is more personalized; the user can utilize our search bar to search for a particular, non-random word. Additionally, the user's previous searches will also be stored and displayed when he or she clicks the search bar.
